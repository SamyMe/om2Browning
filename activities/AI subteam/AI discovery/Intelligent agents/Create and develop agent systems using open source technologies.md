# Create and develop agent systems using open source technologies

    Agents might be one of the most overshadow fields in artificial intelligent, yet it is one of the most interesting and used fields in the industry. Used in video games, robotics, simulation and modeling for economic, social and military ... it can be seen in many applications and contextes. And in this article we will take a look at the open source tools you can use to built it, but first what's an agent system ?

## Agent system

    An agent system is anything which perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or may use knowledge. It can also be computerized into multiple interacting agent to create a multi agent system.

## The imporctance of agent system

    Agent systems are very understimated. Yet their importance in the industry is very important especially reinforcement based intelligent systems. They are used in many fields that are essentials to today society. For military and logistic purposes with drones, to the medical field with simulations and robots. Even fields like finance and banking use agents for multiples things. And most important the entertainement field with video games that use a tons of agents. To summerize even if it may not seems like a very popular it is still one of the most used and important in today industry. 

## The need of open source in agent system

        As it was said previously, the intelligent agent field is very understimated. and it's popularity slowed down in the early 2000. Which made open source the only way for it to survive. As all the devellopement and advancement that was made was thanks to open source contributions. And it was so succesfull and so much advance were made that even big companies like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Activision Blizzard and many others started contributing as well. Which showcase how open source can save a field and make it succesful and powerful again.   

## Open source tools for developing agent systems

    As said above there is a lot of different application of the agents depending on the context. And for this reason the differents tools will be put on categories depending on which application they fit the most.

### Tools to build Intelligent agent systems

    Those are used for general purpose intelligent agents that can be use for many different projects. Most of them helps to create reinforcement learning based agents.

### Tools to build  multi-agent systems

    Those tools are built to create multi-agent systems, which are computerized system composed of multiple interacting agents. Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent. It also useful to make different types of agents collaborate between them in some big and complexe systems.

## Conclusion

    Intelligent agent systems still have a bright futur waiting for it in the industry. And this is thanks to open source and th rise of popularity of reinforcement learning and simulation. The research on this field is becoming more and more prominent when it was slowing down in the begining of 2000 which shows how open source can save a field make it prominent again by contributing to a lot of powerful tools and research.

# Exploratory Data Analysis project

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.

In this project you will use Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to perform an EDA on this dataset :

[Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data)

You will have to create a notebook containing the following steps :

1) ## Getting insights about the dataset

2) ## Handling Missing Values

3) ## Data visualization

When you finish the project share it on your Github and show it to us to pass to become a level 2 member !!!

## Level 1 members challenges and mini project

After mastering Python, it is important to learn how to use important and very useful libraries that will be of a great help in your AI journey. Those tools are used for Data analysis and visualization and are a must for any AI expert. 

Those tools are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn Open Source Python libraries that are extremely used in data science and many others fields.

Here are resources to learn them :

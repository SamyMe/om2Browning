# WHATS INSIDE THIS FOLDER?

Hello everyone! abdelhak here ,
in this folder you can find a couple of files, i'm gonna describe them so you can see what's going on and not be lost, let's get started!

- [hot4.odp](./hot4.odp) and [hot4.pdf](./hot4.pdf) are the same file (have the same content) but with different formats! choose the one you want you're free! (as in freedom)

- [myscript.sh](./myscript.sh) is a script (commented) cloned from travery media's tutorial you'll find the link commented at the top of the file, i also included a link in the (shell scripting.md)[./shell\ scripting.md] file.

- (shell scripting.md)[./shell\ scripting.md] contains some of my notes and example about shell scripting.

- (Envirnment variables.md)[./Envirnment variables.md] contains some of my notes about envirnment variables, and interesting links to understand more.

- (_resources)[./_resources] is just a folder that is needed in order to diplay the content of the markdown files (.md files)it just contains an image of Steve Bourne the original creator of Bourne Shell (he changed the game chwiya ).

# Incubation Program

- Git/Github: Lilia ~
- Arduino: Nada
- Agile Methods - Mohamed
- A Brief Introduction to AI - Ilies
- CRUD Mobile App w/ Flutter
- CRUD Web App
- Installation Linux ~

PS1: the ~ symbol refers to activities that will be done before the program starts so no need for the organizer of incubations to take them into consideration.

PS2: For the Fultter course, I suggest you contact Nada because a friend of hers was interested to organize it before.
